<summary> Problem 1</summary>

We are given a table called ```customer_state_log``` containing the following columns:

* ```cust_id```: The ID of the customer.
* ```state```: The state of the session, where 1 indicates the session is active and 0 indicates the session has ended.
* ```timestamp```: The timestamp when the state change occurred.

Our task is to calculate **how many hours each user was active during the day based on the state transitions**.
